                <p>San Francisco has something for everyone. Foodies
                    should grab a burrito in the Mission and hit up
                    Farmers Market at the Ferry Building. Shop shoes
                    and boutiques in Hayes Valley. Get outside and
                    stroll Golden Gate Park, say "Hi" to the Bison
                    (seriously). See the city from the water by taking
                    a ferry or catamaran under the bridge. Check out
                    current events below.
